We strongly believe that Quantum blockchain can be the gateway to a decentralised future. We have started buidling Quantum Citizen Portal to enable this.

> Horus Chain : 
A one stop space for patients, doctors and healthcare providers to manage their medical records electronically and have access to them anywhere, anytime and in case of emergencies.
~ This can be adapted for various kinds of records management like land records, legal chain of custody documents, etc.

> DDC (Donor Donation Chain) :
It ensures the traceability of the donor, donation, and keeps funds secure. This will tap into donor demand for more information about their impact. User can follow the donations all the way from the donor to the beneficiary and beyond. This will restore the trust of the donors in charitable giving.
